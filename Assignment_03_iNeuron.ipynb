        "\n",
        "Ans: Functions are advantageous to have in programs in Python for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability: Functions allow you to define a block of code that can be executed repeatedly in different parts of your program. This reusability saves you from writing the same code over and over again, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity: Functions enable you to break down your program into smaller, self-contained modules. Each function can perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. By dividing your code into smaller functions, you can tackle complex problems by focusing on smaller, manageable parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Functions allow you to abstract away the implementation details of a particular task. When you define a function, you encapsulate a series of instructions behind a meaningful name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code maintainability: Functions make your code more maintainable by isolating different parts of your program. If you need to make changes or fix bugs, you can focus on a specific function rather than the entire program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Readability and organization: Functions promote clean and readable code. By giving meaningful names to functions, you make your code more self-explanatory and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code reuse across projects: Functions can be written once and reused across multiple projects. If you have a set of utility functions or helper functions that you commonly use, you can create a separate module or library and import it into different projects.\n"

        "Ans:\n",
        "Global Scope: The global scope refers to the outermost level of the program, where variables and functions are defined outside of any function or class. It is accessible from anywhere within the program. The global scope exists throughout the entire execution of the program and is shared among all the modules, functions, and classes.\n",
        "\n",

Each function call or block creates a new local scope. Local scopes are used to store variables and references specific to that function or block of code.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: When a function call returns in Python, the local scope of that function is destroyed, and any variables defined within that local scope cease to exist. This process is known as variable scope and lifetime management.\n",

        "Here's what happens to variables in a local scope when a function call returns:\n",
        "\n",
        "Variable Lifespan: The lifespan of a local variable begins when the function is called and its local scope is created. The variable exists and can be accessed and modified within the function's scope during its lifespan.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variable Destruction: When the function call returns, the local scope of the function is destroyed. At this point, any variables defined within that local scope are also destroyed, and their memory is released. The variables are no longer accessible or available for use outside the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that the destruction of local variables upon function return ensures that the memory they occupied is freed up for other purposes, optimizing memory usage in the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variable Inaccessibility: Once the local scope is destroyed, any attempt to access the variables defined within that local scope from outside the function will result in an error. The variables are confined to the local scope of the function and are not accessible from the global scope or other functions.\n",

        "Ans: The concept of a return value in Python refers to the value that a function sends back or returns to the calling code. When a function is executed, it may perform certain operations or calculations and produce a result. The return value allows the function to communicate that result back to the calling code, which can then use or process the returned value further.\n",

Place the code that might raise an exception inside the try block, and specify the type of exception you want to handle in the except block. If an exception of that type occurs, the code within the except block will be executed, allowing you to gracefully handle the error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally Block: Optionally, you can include a finally block after the try-except block. The code within the finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This block is typically used for tasks that should be executed regardless of the outcome, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging: Implement logging to record error information or messages to a log file. The logging module in Python provides a flexible and configurable logging system. By logging relevant details about the error, you can analyze and debug issues more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Graceful Handling: In some cases, you may want to handle specific errors in a way that allows the program to continue running. By catching the exception, taking appropriate actions (e.g., providing default values, displaying an error message), and continuing the program execution, you can prevent a crash and provide a fallback mechanism."
